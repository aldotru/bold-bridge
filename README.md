## ðŸš€ Project summary

The main idea behing building this project is to start learning about [**Astro**](https://astro.build/), and start playing around with technologies like:

- JAMstack
- Headless CMS
- Tailwind CSS
- and probably an animation library (GSAP)

I'm sure this will be a really cool learning project ðŸ¤˜
